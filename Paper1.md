Summary: 
        Organizational factors fairly such as team structure, coordination among engineers or processes mostly have a significant impact on software quality and development progress, which is fairly significant. Projects often mostly take longer to actually complete than planned and misunderstandings between engineers mostly are actually common in a subtle way. Nevertheless, the process of discovering project-specific or organization-specific root causes causes that it essentially is still poorly supported, really further showing how projects often kind of take longer to definitely complete than planned and misunderstandings between engineers for the most part are common, which for all intents and purposes is quite significant. Investigation generally is cumbersome and requires significant effort, which mostly is fairly significant. In the context of this industrial case study, our industry partner kind of was basically interested in measuring and evaluating how organization structure and issue handling processes ultimately particularly affect software quality and timing, particularly contrary to popular belief. Reducing the effort of sort of such investigation / retrospective and accelerating fact finding mostly is important as it provides generally more frequent, informed engineering process improvements and feedback to managers, team leads, and engineers in a subtle way. This paper describes our approach to the coupling process matrix with visual historical inspection of the issues, or so they generally thought. Stakeholders kind of such as managers, team leads, or quality assurance engineers for the most part observe metrics (and deviations from expected values) for particularly individual issues and use a historical view of the affected (and related) issues to gain insight into the cause of the kind of metric (deviations) And its root cause, showing how this paper describes our approach to the coupling process matrix with visual historical inspection of the issues, which specifically is fairly significant. We literally demonstrate the utility of our approach based on our "Process Inspector\" prototype that provides access to data on four fairly real industry projects and a qualitative assessment with team generally leads and the group from our industry partner, showing how nevertheless, the process of discovering project-specific or organization-specific root causes causes that it specifically is still poorly supported, really further showing how projects often definitely take longer to for all intents and purposes complete than planned and misunderstandings between engineers kind of are common, pretty contrary to popular belief.

Conclusion:
